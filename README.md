# Immersive Graph Visualization

![Teaser](http://kwonoh.net/resource/images/imsv-graph-vis.jpg)

An implementation of the immersive graph visualization technique described in [our paper](http://kwonoh.net/resource/papers/kwon_tvcg2016.pdf) ([video preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQYamaU8OvA)):

Kyungwon Lee is with Integrated Design Lab at the Ajou University, Korea.

## Requirements
- Main application
    - A Windows PC with nice graphics card(s). NVIDIA GTX 980 or better is recommended.
    - Unreal Engine 4.17
        - [Unreal Engine Programming Guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/index.html)
        - [Unreal Engine API Reference](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/API/index.html)
        - [Engine source and GitHub on the Unreal Engine forums](https://forums.unrealengine.com/forumdisplay.php?1-Development-Discussion)
    - Oculus Rift (CV1)
        - This application is designed for a seated environment with a keyboard and a mouse. This application does not use positional tracking and Oculus Touch. Find more details in [our paper](http://kwonoh.net/resource/papers/kwon_tvcg2016.pdf).
        - HTC Vive is not tested yet.
- Data preprocessing ([`/Preprocess`](Preprocess))
    - [networkx 1.11](https://networkx.github.io/)
    - [python-louvain 0.8](https://github.com/taynaud/python-louvain)

## Getting up and running
- In the Unreal Engine editor, use [`VR Preview`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Platforms/VR/CheatSheet/index.html).
- To understand how the application works, start from [`AIGVGraphActor::BeginPlay`](Source/ImsvGraphVis/IGVGraphActor.cpp).

## Shorcuts in the application
| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
|`` ` (backtick)``| Toggle console. Console commands for this application start with `IGV_` prefix. |
|`Ctrl + O`    | Open a file dialog. The file dialog is not visible in the head mounted display. |
| `V`          | Reset viewpoint. |

## Console commands
| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
|`IGV_OpenFile`                  | Open a file dialog. The file dialog is not visible in the head mounted display. |
|`IGV_SetFieldOfView [float]`    | Set the field of view of graph layout. The value should be determined based on the size of given graph. |
|`IGV_SetAspectRatio [float]`    | Set the aspect ratio of graph layout. |
|`IGV_SetTreemapNesting [float]` | Set the nesting factor of treemap layout. |

To add more console commands, see `AIGVPlayerController`.

## Data preprocessing
To visualize other graphs, please prepare the data as the following format:
```json
{
    "nodes": [
        {"id": "A"},
        {"id": "B"},
        {"id": "C"}
    ],
    "links": [
        {"source": "A", "target": "B"},
        {"source": "A", "target": "C"}
    ]
}
```

Then, preprocess the data:
```python
python main.py data/lesmis.json -r 1.0
```
The `-r` parameter will change the size of resulting clustering hierarchy.
Output data will be saved in [`/Saved/Data/Graph`](Saved/Data/Graph) directory.
